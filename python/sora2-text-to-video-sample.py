Sora-2 Text-to-Video Generation Sample

This script demonstrates how to use the Azure OpenAI Sora-2 model to generate videos
from text prompts. Sora-2 is a state-of-the-art AI model that creates realistic and
imaginative video content based on natural language descriptions.

Requirements:
    - Python 3.7+
    - openai library (install via: pip install openai)
    - python-dotenv library (install via: pip install python-dotenv)
    - Valid Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint in .env file

Usage:
    python sora2-text-to-video-sample.py

# Video generation parameters
prompt = '''Create a 4-econd, photoreal cinematic shot. In a sunlit, minimalist café, a red panda stands on a sturdy stool behind a stainless-steel espresso bar and pours latte art into a ceramic cup. The animal's movement is precise and confident—unexpectedly expert.
Camera: 35 mm lens, close-medium framing, gentle push-in (dolly) from right to left; slight handheld micro-jitter for realism.
Action beat: In one smooth motion, the red panda tilts the pitcher and draws a crisp rosetta pattern; steam swirls rise; a micro-splash lands on the saucer (shallow depth of field catches droplets in bokeh).
Lighting & look: Late-morning natural light, soft shadows, warm color temperature; high-detail fur, whiskers, and reflective metal surfaces; subsurface scattering on ears; subtle condensation on the milk pitcher.
Environment cues: Background defocused café plants and wood grain; no logos, no text, no humans.
Tone: Wholesome, delightful, subtly humorous; no slapstick.
End frame (hold ~0.4s): The red panda sets the cup down, proud head tilt to camera as steam curls upward.
Safety & realism: Anatomically plausible proportions; stable footing; appropriate utensil sizes.'''
